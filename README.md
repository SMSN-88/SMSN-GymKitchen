# SMSN-GymKitchen
So let me start of by saying, I only made this project after I almost landed my first Freelance client that wanted me to build a simple website for their restaurant. 
Although half way through me starting their website they decided they no longer needed it which annoyed the hell out of me as I was hoping this was the step in the right direction I needed to feel like a Web Developer.
Alas, That fell through and I was left with this sense of needing closure, I needed to know if I can actually build a half decent restaurant style website, which has allowed me to build this project you see before you.
I based this project on my love for the Gym as well as a healthy nutrional diet.
As you can see by the codes, I oly used HTML & CSS (one of these days I'll make a project solely based on JS).
I didn't run into too much trouble building this, as once i knew what directin I was going everyhting kind of fell into place, which has never happened to me before, usually I sit here scrathing my head as to what to add next.
Please feel free to let me know what you think of my project or any project I have on my GitHub at this moment in time and I'll happily answer any questions.
